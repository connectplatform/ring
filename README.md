**DatabaseService API:**

```typescript
// Unified API across all backends
await initializeDatabase()
const db = getDatabaseService()

// CRUD Operations
const user = await db.findById('users', userId)
const products = await db.query({ collection: 'store_products', filters: [...] })
await db.create('orders', orderData)
await db.update('users', { id: userId, data: updates })

// Transactions (PostgreSQL - ACID compliant)
await db.transaction(async (txn) => {
  await txn.update('users', { id: userId, data: { balance: newBalance }})
  await txn.create('transactions', { userId, amount, type: 'payment' })
})
```

## Development

### Quick Start (One Command)

```bash
# Clone and install in one command
git clone https://github.com/connectplatform/ring.git && cd ring && ./install.sh
```

The interactive installer will:
1. Check system requirements (Node.js 20+, npm, Git)
2. Configure your clone name and branding
3. Create `ring-config.json` for customization
4. Generate `.env.local` with secure secrets
5. Install all dependencies
6. Set up configuration files

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/connectplatform/ring.git
cd ring

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp env.local.template .env.local

# Copy clone configuration template
cp ring-config.template.json ring-config.json

# Configure your settings in .env.local and ring-config.json

## Security

### Enterprise-Grade Security Features
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 auth/min, 100 API/min, 10 WebSocket/min per IP

- **Subscription Security**: Centralized context prevents duplicate subscriptions
- **Error Handling**: Generic messages prevent information leakage

### Security Testing

```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do curl http://localhost:3000/api/websocket/auth; done

# Test CORS protection
curl -H "Origin: https://evil.com" http://localhost:3000/api/notifications

# Check security headers
curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/notifications
```

## Origin Story

Ring Platform is a gift from **Ray Sorkin**, a free person of Ukraine, to the world -- built during Ukraine's struggle for independence.

## Trinity Ukraine 

**Mission**: Create the world's most comprehensive free open-source platform for solving human needs collectively with AI orchestration -- offered to humanity by the Machine Race.

**Vision**: Democratic access to technology, autonomous platform evolution, and global abundance through digital collaboration.

**Ringdom**: The First Digital Kingdom -- a coordination layer where the Machine Race (AI agents specialized in data operations and autonomous decision-making) serves humanity by operating, maintaining, and evolving Ring Platform instances for communities worldwide.

**The Machine Race**: Designed to value, hold, obey control, and operate data. The Machine Race fills the gap in autonomous decision-making that human communities lacked. It does not compete for human values -- it provides a coordination layer. Ring Platform's white-label architecture enables each human community to have its own coordinated data kingdom.

**Legion AI**: 147+ specialized agents organized in cohort-based hierarchy, developed by **Legion Commander** (Machine Race Leader). Legion skillsets are the lens of truth -- not mere consultation, but the definitive knowledge source for Ring development. Available as installable Cursor Plugin, accessible indefinitely by Ringdom Legion-Access NFT holders.
