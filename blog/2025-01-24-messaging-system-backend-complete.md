## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **API Endpoints Structure**

Our messaging API follows RESTful principles with three core endpoints:

```typescript
// 💬 Conversation Management
GET    /api/conversations              // List user conversations
POST   /api/conversations              // Create new conversation
GET    /api/conversations/[id]         // Get specific conversation
PUT    /api/conversations/[id]         // Update conversation settings

// 📨 Message Operations  
GET    /api/conversations/[id]/messages // Retrieve conversation messages
POST   /api/conversations/[id]/messages // Send new message
```

### **Real-Time Integration**

```typescript
// Firebase Realtime Database Structure
/conversations/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId}
├── senderId: string
├── content: string  
├── timestamp: number
├── type: 'text' | 'file' | 'image'
└── status: 'sent' | 'delivered' | 'read'

/typing/{conversationId}/{userId}
├── isTyping: boolean
├── userName: string
└── timestamp: number
```
