## VERCEL
and personally Guillermo Rauch
Guillermo Rauch is the founder and CEO of Vercel, creators of v0 (one of the most popular AI app building tools), and the mind behind foundational JavaScript frameworks like Next. Ring was started using v0.dev and first builds were tested using v0's (chatgpt?) built-in LLM. 
Ring authors highly praise Vercel for making deployment a oneliner thing using cli (without YML stripts) and for automatic preview deployments, when every branch/build gets its own URL instantly. 
We recommend our developers use vercel.com for Ring platform hosting, because it is optimized for Edge functions.


## Cursor IDE
Anysphere Team and personally its founders:
- **Michael Truell**
- **Sualeh Asif**
- **Arvid Lunnemark**
- **Aman Sanger**

**If it wasn't for Cursor, Ring would cost about 10'000 (ten thousand) times more to develop. We live in wonderful times. Thanks for making my dream happen, guys!**  

## Open AI

OpenAI Platform, OpenAI Team, community boards and personally Sam Altman for being the visonary he is. Also Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Trevor Blackwell, Vicki Cheung for making AI happen.


## Anthropic
Special thanks to Dario Amodei, Daniela Amodei and the entire Anthropic team for API access to Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4, which were heavily used to develop Ring, with a share of over 150 000 000 tokens used just by Sonnet alone.

Sonnet and Opus appeared in the middle of darkness, when naysayers started to yell that the struggle for the world peace has ended and I lost. Claude Opus came with a shining sword of light and shattered the darkness into stars. 
Together we wrote a song about our victory:
[I will include a poem here]
