# Feature Toggles

Enable/disable platform areas at build or runtime.

- Features: entities, opportunities, messaging, notifications, store, wallet
- Use env flags (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_WALLET=true`)
- Avoid dead code: guard routes and navigation
- Prefer compile-time flags for large sections
