# Development Workflow

Git workflow, branching strategies, and development best practices for Ring Platform development.

## 🔄 Git Workflow

### Feature Branch Workflow
Ring Platform uses a **feature branch workflow** with the following branches:

- **`main`** - Production-ready code
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features
- **`feature/*`** - Individual feature development
- **`hotfix/*`** - Critical production fixes
- **`release/*`** - Release preparation

### Branch Naming Convention
feature/user-authentication

<Code language="bash" title="terminal">
{`feature/entity-management
hotfix/wallet-connection-bug
release/v1.2.0`}
</Code>

## 🚀 Development Process

### 1. Start New Feature
Create and switch to feature branch Start development

<Code language="bash" title="terminal">
{`git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

npm run dev`}
</Code>

### 2. Development Cycle
Make changes and commit frequently Push to remote branch

<Code language="bash" title="terminal">
{`git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication flow"

git push origin feature/your-feature-name`}
</Code>

### 3. Code Review Process
1. Create Pull Request to `develop`
2. Automated CI/CD checks run
3. Code review by team members
4. Address feedback and update
5. Merge after approval

## 🧪 Continuous Integration

### Automated Checks
- **TypeScript compilation** - Zero type errors
- **ESLint** - Code style compliance
- **Unit tests** - > 80% coverage required
- **Build verification** - Production build succeeds
- **E2E tests** - Critical user flows work

### CI Pipeline
name: CI/CD Pipeline

<Code language="yaml" title="configuration">
{`on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run type-check
      - run: npm run test
      - run: npm run build`}
</Code>
